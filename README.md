# FunctionalProgramming
This project contains code I wrote while following [Functional Programming](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/functional-programming-for/9780134778235) course by Simon Roberts.

### Description
The __FunctionalProgramming__ project is written using Java 9.

We start with a traditional object oriented design pattern and move to a functional foundation. 
We do this for filtering and sorting of objects.

We learn about:
1. Lambda expressions and their syntax variations (block lambdas, expression lambdas,
with or without type specifiers, single arguments without brackets).
2. Functional interfaces and the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation.
3. Closures and the concept of _effectively final_.
4. Higher order functions.
